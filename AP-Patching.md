Hi, in this tutorial, you will learn how to patch nds roms to make them playable in Twilightmenu++. This guide will guide you through dumping your cart to ap patch the rom.

**What you will need**
* A hacked 3DS with Luma with [Godmode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases/tag/v1.8.0) (`Godmode9.firm` in `luma/payloads`)  
* DS carts or DSi Enhanced carts
(how to make the difference between carts pic)
* DS-Scene ROM tool (link that mah boi)
* (Optional) [xDelta Patcher](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xdelta3-gui/files/latest/download) 
***

__Note that you can skip Section I if you've already dumped your cart to an untrimmed format__

### Section I: Dumping
1. Boot your 3DS console while holding the Start button to boot into Godmode9
> If Godmode9 1.8.0 hangs to a splash screen, has blank screen(s), or its just not booting at all, make a copy of the `Godmode9.firm` and rename this copy to whatever you'd like, so after that, you will have __two__ .firm files in `luma/payloads`
